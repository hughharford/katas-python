# Stuff I learnt and hopefully what I can do to improve!

## Rushing
- Causes endless frustration, long delays and really isn't worth it
- `WHAT TO DO INSTEAD`
  - Go slowly and carefully! So much more fun and so much faster!

## Not fully reading the instructions
- e.g. Day 2 challenges, done on Day 3 (so rushing!):
  - Assumed 3 x string input, but was `ACTUALLY` a list
- `WHAT TO DO INSTEAD`
  - Read the instructions really carefully! Especially key bits like inputs and outputs - DOH!

## Getting fully confused and stuff
- E.g. Day 2 warm up exercises, should've been pretty simple
- RESULTS:
  - Way complex code
  - Delays reaching a result
  - Huge frustration
- `WHAT TO DO INSTEAD`
  - Realise early if this has happened
  - Employ obvious tactics like:
    - always using i for horizontal, j for vertical and k for a 3rd dimension
    - writing out a simple grid to help spot the pattern
    - NOT rushing (see above)!
    - NOT not fully reading the instructions (see above)!

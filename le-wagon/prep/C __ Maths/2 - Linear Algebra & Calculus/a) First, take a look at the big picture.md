## WARM UP:

### [Notation SYSTEM](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413231704/https://the-learning-machine.com/article/math/notation)

### [Functions](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413231546/https://the-learning-machine.com/article/math/functions)
See file Functions NOTES.md

  
## ADVANCED

### [Sets](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413214217/https://the-learning-machine.com/article/math/sets)

### [Relations](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413231744/https://the-learning-machine.com/article/math/relations) Essentials make simple sense, but many possibilities from there.

### [DataTypes:](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413222941/https://the-learning-machine.com/article/linear-algebra/data-types)
1. Scalars
   1. greek $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ etc for constant
   2. x, y, z, for variables
2. Vectors
   1. 1-D collection of scalars
   2. $\color{yellow}a\in\mathbb{R}^n$ = [row / column vector]
   3. Transpose row to column and v.v with $\color{yellow}a = b^T$ and $\color{yellow}b = a^T$
   4. Column vector precedent
3. Matrices

## WARM UP:

### [Notation SYSTEM](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413231704/https://the-learning-machine.com/article/math/notation)

### [Functions](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413231546/https://the-learning-machine.com/article/math/functions)

- $\color{yellow} f: A \to B$ denotes a function of set A to B
- a relation of set A to B, so that $\color{yellow} a \in A$ is the first coordinate in exactly one ordered pair in $\color{yellow} f$ 
- Therefore the cardinality of $\color{yellow}f$ matches A 
- ## Image of a function
- If $\color{yellow} f(a,b) \in f$ then we write $\color{yellow} b = f(a)$ 
- then B is the **image** of A
- and  f **maps** A to B
- Hence, functions are sometimes called mappings

## ADVANCED

### [Sets](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413214217/https://the-learning-machine.com/article/math/sets)

### [Relations](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413231744/https://the-learning-machine.com/article/math/relations) Essentials make simple sense, but many possibilities from there.

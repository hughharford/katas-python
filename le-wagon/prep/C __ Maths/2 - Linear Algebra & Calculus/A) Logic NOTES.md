## Logic: Propositions
    "A proposition is a sentence or a mathematical expression that is either definitely true or definitely false"
- Also known as statements
  - Subtle difference: 
    - a proposition is an abstract logical concept
    - the statement is the way of expressing that concept.
  - So, 2 different statements e.g. in 2 different languages, can express the same proposition
  - Propositions cannot be questions, procedures, or just numbers. Any theorem or result that has been proved true is a proposition
  - Examples of true propositions
    - The integer 2 is even
    - 32 is divisible by 16
    - No odd number is divisible by 2
  - Examples of false propositions
    - 5=2
    - $\color{yellow} R ⊆ N$  
    - $n.b. ⊆ == subset$
  - Examples of non-propositions
    - Add 2
    - to both sides
    - 42
    - What is the solution of 4x=32?
- ## Logic: Proposition notation
  - Denote a proposition with capital, start P,Q,R,…
  - E.g., consider the following propositions
    - P: The integer 2 is even.
    - Q: 32 is divisible by 16
- ## Logic: Open sentence
  - A proposition with variables is known as an open sentence, predicate, open statement, or a propositional function.
  - Open sentences are denoted by parametrizing the corresponding proposition with the variable.
  - e.g.
    - P(x): An open sentence that involves variable x
  - Examples of Open Sentences:
    - $\color{yellow} P(x): The\,integer\,x\,is\,divisible\,by\,3$
    - $\color{yellow} Q(x,y): 5x = 2y$
- ## Logic: Open sentence over a domain
  - In the case of an open sentence with the variable x, if the domain of the variable x is known to be the set S, then the proposition is known as an **open sentence over the domain S**
- ## Logic: Truth value
  - Every proposition has a truth value, namely **true** or **false**, usually denoted by **T** and **F**, respectively.
  - E.g.
    - For the proposition "Every even number is divisible by 2", the truth value is **T** 
    - For the proposition "49 is divisible by 9", the truth value is **F**
- ## Logic: Truth table
  - The possible truth values of a proposition are listed in a table known as a **truth table**

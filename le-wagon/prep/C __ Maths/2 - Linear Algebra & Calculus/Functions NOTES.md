### [Functions](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413231546/https://the-learning-machine.com/article/math/functions)

- $\color{yellow} f: A \to B$ denotes a function of set A to B
- a relation of set A to B, so that $\color{yellow} a \in A$ is the first coordinate in exactly one ordered pair in $\color{yellow} f$ 
- Therefore the cardinality of $\color{yellow}f$ matches A 
- ## Image of a function
  - If $\color{yellow} f(a,b) \in f$ then we write $\color{yellow} b = f(a)$ 
  - then B is the **image** of A
  - and  f **maps** A to B
  - Hence, functions are sometimes called mappings
- ## Pre-image of a function
  - a is the pre-image of $\color{yellow} f(a)$

- ## Domain and Codomain of a function
  - for $\color{yellow} f : A \to B$
  - A is the domain, B is the codomain
- ## Range of a function
  - range is a subet of codomain, but not always equal
  - for $f$ the range of f = the subset of B that appears as second coordinate in f
  - $\color{yellow} range(f)=\{f(x):x \in A\}$
  - Written as $\color{yellow} range(f)$
- ### Example:
  - with sets $\color{yellow}A={1,2,3}$ and $\color{yellow}B={x,y,z}$
  - with the function $\color{yellow} f:A \to B$:
    - $\color{yellow}f={(1,x),(2,y),(3,x)}$
  - $\color{yellow}range(f)={x,y}$
  - Note also that $\color{yellow}range(f)⊂B$ (subset)
- ## Equality of functions
  - Functions $\color{yellow}f:A→B$ and $\color{yellow}g:A→B$ are said to be equal if $\color{yellow}f(a)=g(a)$ for all $\color{yellow}a∈A$
  - HSTH I.e. Inputs (domain) and Outputs (range) are the same
- ## Inverse image of a function 
  - Going the other way, so that: the inverse image of the range of a function is its domain
- ## One-to-one functions / injective functions
  - Also known as injective functions
  - one-to-one function if no two elements of A have the same image in B
  - For injective functions from set A to set B, it is always the case that the codomain has at least as many elements as the domain, $\color{yellow}|A|≤|B|$
  - $\color{yellow}nb:  |Cardinality|$
- ## Onto functions / surjective functions
  - onto function if every element of the codomain B is the image of some element of the domain A. 
  - also known as surjective functions
  - so codomain is also the range of the function
  - for surjective functions, the domain has at least as many elements as the codomain, $\color{yellow}|A|≥|B|$
- ## Bijective functions
  - bijective or a one-to-one correspondence if it is both one-to-one and onto
  - bijective functions, $\color{yellow}|A|=|B|$
  - So, if the cardinality of A and B is n, then there are **n!** possible bijective functions of the form $\color{yellow}f:A \to B$ between them
  - __Bijective (one-to-one and onto):__

- ## Identity function is bijective
  - The identity function maps an element to itself
  - It is defined as $\color{yellow}iA:A\to A$ 
  - such that $\color{yellow}a=iA(a),∀a∈A$
  - ∀ = for every
  - ∈ = is a member of
- ## Inverse function
  - $\color{yellow} f^{−1} ={(b,a):(a,b)∈f}$
  - i.e. image is the domain
  - to have an inverse function, the original function $f$ must be bijective, both onto and one-to-one
  - Further, if $f$ is bijective, then so is $f^{−1}$.
- ## Preimage of an inverse function
  - The preimage is a concept is analogous to the image of a function, but applied to the inverse (i.e. just the other way around)
  - E.g. the image of the function == the preimage of the inverse function
- ## Composition of functions
  - The composition $\color{yellow} g ∘ f$ of the functions $\color{yellow} f:A\to B$ and $\color{yellow} g:B→C$ is a function from A to C
  - such that
$$\color{yellow} (g∘f)(a)=g(f(a)),∀a∈A$$
  - ### Properties of composite functions:
    - If f and g are injective (one-to-one), then so is $\color{yellow} g ∘ f$
    - If f and g are surjective (onto), then so is $\color{yellow} g ∘ f$
    - Thus, if f and g are bijective, then so is $\color{yellow} g ∘ f$.
- ## Associative composite function
  - A composition of functions f,g, and h is said to be associative if $\color{yellow}h∘(g∘f)=(h∘g)∘f$
- ## The Pigeonhole Principle
  - $\color{yellow}f:A→B$ between two finite sets A and B
  - If $\color{yellow}|A|>|B|$ then f is not injective, because multiple elements in A will map to the same element in B
  - If $\color{yellow}|A|<|B|$, then f is not surjective, because there are elements in B that are not the image of any element in A.
  - SO:
  - This observation is known as the **pigeonhole principle** in Mathematics and comes from the idea that if n objects (pigeons) are put into m containers (pigeon-holes), such that n>m, then some containers will end up containing more than one object.

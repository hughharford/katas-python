# A) LINEAR ALGEBRA NOTES
## First, take a look at the big picture (note, part of part a!)


### [DataTypes:](https://web.archive.org/web/20210413222941/https://the-learning-machine.com/article/linear-algebra/data-types)
- Scalars
   1. greek $\alpha, \beta, \gamma$ etc for constant
   2. x, y, z, for variables
- Vectors
   1. 1-D collection of scalars
   2. $\color{yellow}a\in\mathbb{R}^n$ = [row / column vector]
   3. Transpose row to column and v.v with $\color{yellow}a = b^T$ and $\color{yellow}b = a^T$
   4. Column vector precedent
- Matrices
   - Let's stack each vector in the **set** $\color{yellow} {\{a1,…,am}\}$ such that $\color{yellow} a_i∈R^n,∀i$ as shown below and refer to the entire box by the symbol A, a matrix:
  $\color{yellow} 
  \begin{bmatrix} 
  a_{1,1} … a_{1,n} \\⋮⋱⋮\\ a_{m,1} … a_{m,n}
  \end{bmatrix}$
   - Here, $ai,j$ represents the $j$-th element of the $i$-th vector. 
   - This composite representation of multiple vectors is known as a matrix. It is a 2-dimensional data type
   - **ROW**: $\color{yellow}  
    [a_{1,1},a_{1,2},…,a_{1,n}]$ form the first **row** of the matrix **A**
   - **COLUMN**: $\color{yellow}
    [a_{1,1},a_{2,1},…,a_{m,1}]$ form the first **column** of the matrix **A**
   - **DIAGONAL** of the matrix. For example, the elements $\color{yellow}
    [a_{1,1},a_{2,2},…,a_{n,n}]$ form the **diagonal** of the `matrix A.

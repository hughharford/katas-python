# key properties and their usage/meaning

1. p-value is the indicator of statistical significance
2. Ordinary Least Square - a model that reduces the L2 distance
3. F-statistic
   1. high numbers - show a 'solid result'
   2. if = 1, you cannot rule out that the linear regression is not statistically significant
4. heteroscedasticity
   1. issue: gives smaller than realistic p-values, making the prediction seem more accurate
5. std errors
6. t-stats
7. variance
8. std, standard deviation = sqrt(variance)
9. z-score - no. s.d's from the mean (t-score for a t-distribution)
10. confidence interval
11. R-squared
   1. coefficient of determination or r-squared:
   2. definition: the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is predictable from variance of the features.
12. inferential analysis
    1. Assumptions for:
       1. Linearity
       2. Independence
       3. Homoscedasticity
          1. variance of the residual, or error term, in a regression model is constant. That is, the error term does not vary much as the value of the predictor variable changes.
       4. Normality
13. Residual
    1.  The error term - real v predicted, element wise
